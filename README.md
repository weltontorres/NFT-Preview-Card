# NFT Preview Card
 
## Welcome! 
Thanks for checking out my code.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process
- I structured all the HTML first
- I used CSS custom properties to style
- I used the Flexbox to locate each element where it should be

### What I learned
In this challenge I increased my skills using HTML tags to separete it in blocks, for exemple: 

```<div class="container">
   <div class="ethview">
     <span>
     </span>          
     <span>
     </span> 
   </div>
  </div>
  ```


I also trained the CSS styling to select specific parts of the HTML and make it similar to the original template inspiration. I'm really proud of this part of the CSS where I selected a span tag using the child selector without having to create a specific class for that span:
```
.ethview span:first-child {
	color: #20E9F1;
	font-weight: 400;
}
 ```

### Useful resources
- [Icons] (https://fontawesome.com/)
This helped me find incons and use it on easy way.

- [flexbox] (https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand how flexbox works.
